          Daisy the Aussie, with fur so soft and fine A bundle of energy, always
          on the shine She loves to run and play, with boundless glee A loyal
          companion, always there for me
        </p>
        <p>
          With eyes as bright as stars, and a tail that wags She brings me joy,
          in all life's nags She's more than just a pet, she's part of the
          family Daisy the Aussie, will always have a special place in me
